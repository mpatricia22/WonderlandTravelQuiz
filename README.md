# Features

The application intends to attract users to play quiz online.

# Existing Features
# Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is featured on all four pages, with the Quiz name "Quizia" on the left corner with the logo and links to other pages of the website on the right. The links when clicked redirected to the respective pages. The full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Quiz page, About us and Sign Up page and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation.

The navbar will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

# Sign up page
<br>
This page includes a registration form with another level 3 heading where the user will need to complete the form informing personal details such as first name, last name, gender, email address, phone number, address, and postal code in order to sign up for the club. The form contains validation in HTML, so we cannot submit an empty form or enter a non-email address into an email address field.

# Features Left to Implement

1. More quizzes in the Quiz page separated by topics.
2. Travel videos page.
3. Travel blog page.


# Testing


Extensive testing has been performed and no major issues have been found. 

The site works at full capacity, and user friendly and intuitive. The users can easily navigate and achieve their goals without any trouble. 

The website is fully responsive and works well on different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari and also on different screen sizes.

The forms available on the website contain validation in HTML, so there is no way users can submit an empty form or enter a non-email address into an email address field.

I confirmed that the navigation, header, about us, sign-up, and contact text are all readable and easy to understand.

# Bugs

When I deployed my project on github I found out that the video in the landing page was not working, I discovered this was due to the css path.

Fixed to:  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/style.css">
